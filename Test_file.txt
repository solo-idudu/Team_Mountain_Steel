# Test Case: File Organization Process Validation

## Step 1: Manual Testing - CLI and File Handling

1.1. Open CLI tool.
1.2. Execute the file organization command with sample input files.
1.3. Verify that files are organized into appropriate directories as per the rules.
1.4. Manually check the organized files to ensure correct categorization.
1.5. Verify error handling:
     1.5.1. Try organizing non-existing files/directories.
     1.5.2. Verify appropriate error messages are displayed.
1.6. Test edge cases:
     1.6.1. Organize empty directories.
     1.6.2. Organize files with special characters in their names.
     1.6.3. Organize very large files.
1.7. Report any issues or errors encountered during the testing process.

## Step 2: Test Case Automation

2.1. Write automated test scripts to validate file organization.
2.2. Include test cases for different file types, sizes, and directory structures.
2.3. Verify the output directory structure matches the expected structure.
2.4. Automate error scenarios and ensure appropriate error messages are captured.
2.5. Execute the automated test suite.

## Step 3: Version Control and Pull Request

3.1. Create a new branch for the test cases:
    

     git checkout -b file-organization-tests
     
3.2. Commit the automated test scripts:
    

     git add automated_tests/
     git commit -m "Add automated test cases for file organization"
     
3.3. Push the changes to the remote repository:
    

     git push origin file-organization-tests
     
3.4. Create a pull request for testing:
     3.4.1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
     3.4.2. Click on "New Pull Request."
     3.4.3. Select the branch with the test cases.
     3.4.4. Provide a description of the changes made.
     3.4.5. Request reviewers to validate the test cases.
3.5. Reviewers validate the test cases, provide feedback, and approve the pull request if tests pass.

## Step 4: Merge Changes

4.1. Once the pull request is approved, merge the changes into the main branch:
    

     git checkout main
     git merge file-organization-tests
     git push origin main
     

## Step 5: Post-Merge Validation

5.1. After merging, run the automated tests again on the main branch to ensure no regression.
5.2. Verify that the file organization process still functions correctly after merging the changes.
